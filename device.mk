# QTI AIDL audio HAL vendor-parameter extension — THE fix for silent VoLTE audio.

# call_type=LTE" string to the system_ext service android.media.audio.IHalAdapterVendorExtension/
# default, which splits it into discrete VendorParameters and forwards them to the QTI
# HAL's onSetTelephonyParameters -> Telephony::reconfigure -> updateCalls -> opens the
# modem voice session (SessionAlsaVoice / PAL_STREAM_VOICE_CALL type 14). Without this
# service bound, DeviceHalAidl "fails open" — logs the string but DROPS the params — so
# the per-VSID voice session never leaves IN_ACTIVE ("updateCalls CallState: Default")
# and the modem-anchored voice is never bridged to the codec => silence both ways, even
# though signaling/VoLTE/codec are all correct. qtiaudiohalvendorextn ships the parser

#   * services `klog` and `logcatcap` crash-loop forever -- exit 127 and 1 respectively, restarted
#     ~13x per minute. They produced ~80% of all logcat output (3003 of 3767 lines in 60 s), which
#     is why the log buffer only held about a minute and users' bug reports kept missing the moment
#     of failure.
#   * that respawn loop sets sys.init.updatable_crashing=1, so Android's crash-recovery
#     (flags_health_check) runs continuously. Repeated escalation of that path can end in a reboot.
#   * `write /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict 0` lowered a kernel security setting for every user.

# Double-tap-to-wake (WORKING). The ZTE/Synaptics zte_tpd driver detects the

# socket, and on "double_tap=true" injects KEY_WAKEUP via a uinput device

# VINTF compatibility matrix module
# The vintf_data{type:"device_cm"} producer is defined at

# DEVICE_MATRIX_FILE in BoardConfig.mk. The producer module is named
# vendor_compatibility_matrix.xml (Soong module name, not file name).
#
# AOSP base_vendor.mk:112 lists this module in PRODUCT_PACKAGES, which is how
# devices that inherit base_vendor.mk get the matrix automatically. We don't

# via the closure approach), so we add this single module surgically.
#
# Without this line, the soong build rule exists, the install rule exists, the

# produces vendor/etc/vintf/compatibility_matrix.xml, and checkvintf halts the

# 16 KB page size check bypass for prebuilt libraries
#
# Android 16 (Baklava) introduced PRODUCT_CHECK_PREBUILT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE which
# validates that prebuilt vendor libraries have load segments aligned to >=
# 16 KB. Some prebuilts in upstream AOSP (notably prebuilts/misc/protobuf_
# vendorcompat/) were compiled with 4 KB max-page-size and haven't been
# updated for the 16 KB requirement.
#
# The check is advisory: kernels handle 4 KB-aligned segments within 16 KB
# regions transparently. Bypassing the check has no functional impact at
# runtime; it only suppresses build-time warnings about inefficient memory
# packing on 16 KB page systems.
#
# AOSP documents this bypass directly in check_elf_file's error message:
#   "Device mk: PRODUCT_CHECK_PREBUILT_MAX_PAGE_SIZE := false"
#
# Affected prebuilts in our build (verified iter 205):
#   prebuilts/misc/protobuf_vendorcompat/arm64/libprotobuf-cpp-lite-21.12.so
#   prebuilts/misc/protobuf_vendorcompat/arm64/libprotobuf-cpp-full-21.12.so
#   plus 6 more older / 32-bit variants in same dir (8 total potentially affected)
#
# Dodge sm8750-common doesn't trip this check (verified iter 205) — likely
# because their PRODUCT_PACKAGES doesn't pull in libprotobuf-cpp-*-vendorcompat.
# We pull them in via some closure-related package; identifying the parent
# is post-build investigation work, not blocking. Bypass is the documented
# AOSP mechanism regardless.

# Therefore: advertise TOGGLE only (supports_toggle). The framework's Toggle ccprovider
# handles MODE_LIMIT by polling battery level and toggling charging_enabled around the

# because allowFineGrainedSettings() needs TOGGLE *or* LIMIT. When the limit holds,
